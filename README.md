Smart Contract address - 0x14Ea31cDF4d696051ce75A7517a7CaF54Aa31e60

## Purpose :
* I worked on this project to test my abilities to learn about web3 development.  
* This Dapp was created to test my skills using interfaces in smart contracts, connecting wallets, and enabling functions based on the smart contract.

## How does the project work ?

1. The deployed smart contract first checks if the connected wallet address is whitelisted or not using another whitelist smart contract. 
2. All this information is stored on the blockchain and can be Javascript is used to view all this information present on the blockchain. 
3. #### Presale Mint - If the wallet address is whitelisted after connecting with the Dapp (Decentralized application), then presale mint is enabled for the user if the Smart contract is present in the presale mint. 
4. #### Public Mint - If the time limit is exceeded for the presale mint then the public mint if offered for the users. In public mint, any user can mint the token even if they are whitelisted or not.
